This README file is to accompany the following file:

        RUNENG1.zip    RUNEnglish font pack for Windows w/help file



What is this:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"RUNEnglish 1" and "RUNEnglish 2" are MS-Windows 3.1 compatible Truetype (and 
ATM) fonts.  They can be used to write Runic-looking inscriptions with 
MS-Windows applications.  Also included is a Windows Help file detailing the 
revision history, distribution limitations and keyboard mapping of all 
characters in the font. 

These fonts can not be sold for a profit.  (Although, if you really enjoy using 
these fonts and need to find some financial way of showing your appreciation. 
Any and all donations will be gladly accepted.)  CD-ROM and Shareware 
distributors are requested to notify me before distributing these fonts.

These fonts may be used in any publication.  Please contact me if these fonts 
do appear in a publication. I'd like to receive a copy of it, and I may be able 
to provide further assistance by creating custom fonts or clip art for you.

These fonts are Postcard-ware.  If you like these fonts, please send me a 
postcard or letter (using an attractive or interesting stamp). If you supply me 
with your email address, I'll try to write back. You can get my current postal

inaccuracies, or problems with these fonts, or this document, I encourage you

How to install a MS-Windows-3.1 Truetype font:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you don't know how to install new Truetype fonts, follow the directions 
below (Since you are reading this file, I will assume that you have already 
"PKUNZIP'ed" the ZIP file onto a temp directory on your hard disk.):
  - Start MS-Windows-3.1.
  - Go to the MAIN folder and select CONTROL PANEL.
  - Select FONTS.
  - Select ADD.
  - In this dialog box, go to the section marked 'Drives' and use the
    scroll buttons to click on the drive (C:, D:, or whatever) you 
    have the unzipped files to.
  - Use the section marked 'Directories' to the left of 'Drives' to
    select the directory the unzipped files are in.
  - The font names will appear in the section marked 'List of Fonts'.
  - Click on the font you want to install (using the mouse).
  - Click on 'OK'.
This should install the font so that your Windows applications can use it. 
Don't forget to check the RUNES.HLP file included in the ZIP file. It will 
explain the key-mapping and show an example of font usage. 

These fonts should be compatable with Windows95 and OS/2.  But since I don't 
have either of these PC operating systems, I can't explain how to properly 
install them.
